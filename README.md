# S1: Statistical Methods for Data Intensive Science

## Coursework Instructions 25/26

You can replace this `README.md` file with your own when you submit the project.

The assignment question is provided in a jupyter notebook saved in `notebooks/instructions.ipynb`. Your solution should be provided in a notebook saved at `notebooks/solution.ipynb`. The majority of your code should live in a pip installable folder called `s1_sol`, which already contains an example file called `example.py` (you can add other files too), and should be loaded into `notebooks/solution.ipynb`. All other instructions can be found in `notebooks/instructions.ipynb`. 

Your `notebooks/solution.ipynb` notebook should produce files in the `figs` folder called:
 - `figs/Figure1.1.pdf`
 - `figs/Figure1.2.pdf`
 - `figs/Figure1.3.pdf`
 - `figs/Figure1.4.pdf`
 - `figs/Figure2.1.pdf`
 - `figs/Figure2.2.pdf`
 - `figs/Figure3.1.pdf`
 - `figs/Figure3.2.pdf`
 - `figs/Figure4.1.pdf`

Your `notebooks/solution.ipynb` notebook should produce a file called `results.json` with the correct format.

The assignment is due on 17/12/2025. You will lose write access to this repository at 23:59 on 17/12/2025 after which you assignment will be assessed.

Good luck!
